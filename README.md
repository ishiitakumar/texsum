# Texsum
This project is used to generate a brand new, unique essay based on a paragraph/article/text provided to it.

The pretrained Pegasus model is used for text summarization. This summary is then passed to the pretrained BERT model for paraphrasing. A combination of this means that the text that is generated now has unique text. 

The main motivation behind this was to scan through loads of research papers to gain a quick but deep understanding of what the paper is about and what the research found/concluded.
